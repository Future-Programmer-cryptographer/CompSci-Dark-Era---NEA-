Work in progress... to play the game - make sure you have python3 with tkinter installed (and probably some other random packages?) 

Run main.py and then from the Main Menu, navigate to PLay Game --> Single Player --> it should take you to the game board. From there, drag and drop cards into the register slots and hit submit and your robot should move with the move history being updated on the far left as well. The bot should then play its just. Objective is to get to all the checkpoints. 

Current bugs: 
- Multiplayer works, but without move history or checkpoint progress
- Reset Cards button makes the cards disappear
