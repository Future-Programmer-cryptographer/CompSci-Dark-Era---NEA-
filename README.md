## Implementation is almost done! 

# I'm currently in my testing/debugging phase. If you'd like to test run the NEA, follow the steps below: 

1. Download all the files from the 'RoboRally' folder. You will need to ensure you have tkinter and other relevant python packages installed. 
2. Run the main.py file 
3. You should then see the Main Menu screen. If you view the Rules, then you'll have to re-run the code to get back onto the Main Menu Screen. 
4. To play the game, click on the 'Play Game' button and then you will given a choice of 3 game boards to select, or make your custom board (I'd suggest selecting one of the boards as the custom board is still *somewhat* buggy.)
5. Select single player or multiplayer. You should now see the game board screen. There will be some useful information below the main game board which can help you understand the game. 
6. As a general note, if you have accidently dragged a card into the wrong card slot, YOU MUST CLICK ON RESET CARDS or else the robot will not move correctly. The bot should play a move after you've clicked SUBMIT CARDS button. 

## Reporting bugs: 
If you do notice any bugs in the game, please do get back to me and I will try and fixed them asap! 
Otherwise, if you have any other general advice about UI/source code, I'd be very happy to get some feedback. 

# Good luck and Have Fun!
